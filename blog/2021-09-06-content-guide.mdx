Welcome to the Flashbots Research repository, this is a simple guide to assist in contributing research docs to the website.

Firstly, use a `<!--` `truncate` `-->` comment to limit blog post size in the list view.

<!--truncate-->

Now that we're out of the comment zone, below is a couple cheatsheets best practices 

## Metadata & authors

If you're reading this file, you'll notice the file name starts with the date and ends with the extensions `.mdx` the date is important as this is how things are indexed.


### Filenames

The `.mdx` extension is essential to allow our custom visual components to function, it translates to MarkDown eXtended.

### Metadata

At the start of this file is a couple fields for metadata, from tags to authors, to the url name, the page heading.

The system is called FrontMatter and you can read the full option list at [Docusaurus's blog documentation](https://docusaurus.io/docs/api/plugins/@docusaurus/plugin-content-blog#markdown-frontmatter)
